This is an elevator sliding door controller powered by a 3-phase induction motor. 


This is an elevator sliding door controller powered by a 3-phase induction motor.
It needs a unilateral tachometer with 1.9mm resolution as feedback sensor. 
The code is written in C and prepared for highly optimised function of an AVR ATmega64. 
It provides 3 PWM channels for a proper IGBT module to make a smooth and high-efficient sinusoidal output to run a 3-phase motor.
